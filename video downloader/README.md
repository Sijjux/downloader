- **yt-dlp** - Advanced YouTube video downloader
- **ffmpeg** - Multimedia processing library for video merging and audio extraction
- **Gunicorn** - WSGI server for production deployment

## Troubleshooting

### "FFmpeg not found" error
Ensure ffmpeg is installed and added to your system PATH. You can verify by running:
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

If the command is not recognized:
1. Check that ffmpeg is installed
2. Verify that the bin directory is in your PATH
3. Restart your terminal/command prompt

### Download issues
- Make sure you're using a valid YouTube URL
- Some videos may have restrictions that prevent downloading
- Check your internet connection

### Performance issues
- The first request for a video will be slower as metadata needs to be fetched
- Subsequent requests for the same video are cached for 5 minutes
- Selecting "Best Available" quality is typically faster than specific resolutions
