## Key Features

1. **Video and Audio Downloading**:
   - Download YouTube videos in MP4 format
   - Extract audio from YouTube videos in MP3 format
   - Quality selection from 360p to 4K resolution

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Caching system for faster repeated requests
   - Optimized yt-dlp configuration
   - Efficient resource management

3. **User Interface**:
   - Modern, responsive web design
   - Video preview before download
   - Real-time feedback during processing

4. **Deployment Ready**:
   - Multiple deployment options (Railway, Heroku, Docker, traditional servers)
   - Health check endpoint for monitoring
   - Production-ready configuration

## Deployment Options

### 1. Railway.app (Recommended)
- Uses `railway.json` and `nixpacks.toml` configuration files
- Automatic ffmpeg installation via Nixpacks
- Free tier available

### 2. Heroku (No Git Required)
- Uses `deploy_heroku.bat` or `deploy_heroku.ps1` scripts
- Container stack for ffmpeg support
- Automatic deployment without Git

### 3. Heroku (With Git)
- Traditional Git-based deployment
- Environment variable support

### 4. Docker
- Pre-configured Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
- Includes ffmpeg in the container
- Easy scaling and deployment

### 5. Traditional Servers
- Supports any Python-compatible hosting
- Detailed setup instructions in DEPLOYMENT.md
- Gunicorn for production WSGI server

## Environment Variables

- `PORT`: Port for the application (default: 5000)
- `FLASK_ENV`: Environment setting (default: production)

## Health Check Endpoint

- `/health`: Returns JSON status information
- Useful for monitoring and uptime checks

## Dependencies

- Flask: Web framework
- yt-dlp: YouTube video downloader
- gunicorn: Production WSGI server
- ffmpeg: Multimedia processing (included in Docker images and Railway deployment)

## Startup Scripts

- `start.sh`: Unix/Linux startup script
- `start.bat`: Windows startup script
- Automatically sets up virtual environment and dependencies

## FFmpeg Installation

- `install_ffmpeg.ps1`: PowerShell installation script
- `install_ffmpeg.bat`: Windows batch installation script
- Manual installation instructions for all platforms

## Deployment Scripts

- `deploy_heroku.ps1`: PowerShell Heroku deployment (no Git required)
- `deploy_heroku.bat`: Windows batch Heroku deployment (no Git required)
- `package_for_deployment.bat`: Creates ZIP package for manual deployment
- `test_railway_deployment.bat`: Verifies Railway deployment files

This project is ready for immediate deployment to any of the supported platforms with minimal configuration required.
